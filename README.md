# Palindrome
## Analyze a **word** or a **number** and tell us if it's "Palindrome" or not.

### PALINDROME:
This is a competitive programming exercise, a **palindrome** is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam, racecar.
  
The application to be solved must contain all those validations that allow to determine if a string is or not a palindrome, **no matter** if within the string to be captured there are symbols, spaces or any special characters.
  
When compiling the application you should only request the string to be captured which will be of length "n".
  
Then show the following results:
- In case it is a palindrome, it must print the phrase **"The string entered is a palindrome"**.
- If it is not a palindrome, you must print the phrase **"The string entered is not a palindrome"** and the number of characters that matched to determine whether or not it is a palindrome.
  
```  
Examples:

Input: "Allí toca Pedro Netoxas, saxo tenor de pacotilla"
Result: "The entered chain is a palindrome"
  
Input: "Saco sal, ayo, del yoda y le doy a las ocas"
Result: "The entered chain is NOT a palindrome -  14"
  
Input: "14941"
Result: "The entered chain is a palindrome"

Input: "tattarrattat"
Result: "The entered chain is a palindrome"

Input: "Rotvator"
Result: "The entered chain is NOT a palindrome -  3"
```
